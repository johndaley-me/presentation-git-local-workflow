note:
Here's the thing. I think this CI this is important because with a DVCS
it's easy to get long lived branches and end up with semantic conflicts.
And continuous integration is a two way street. Just because you are pulling
daily, that doesn't really help other people who are developing right now
and aren't aware of your changes.
