##  Your First Pull Request

```bash
✔ ~/git4fun [mainline|✔]
$ git pull
$ git checkout -b my-first-feature
$ git add some-file
$ git commit -m 'Add some-file'
$ git push -u origin my-first-feature
Create pull request.
Take a break!?
```

note:
Actually, now would be a good time to review open pull requests.
Then take a break? No way. Jump into the next feature.

naming convention doesn't matter
Use the wip- prefix so you remember this is a local branch
Alway branch from the default branch.
Gitflow you would use "develop" or whatever is the name of your default branch.
