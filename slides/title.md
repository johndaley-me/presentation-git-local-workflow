# Git Local Workflow
## Part 1: Local Branching Basics
By John Daley

note:
How to create branches locally.
Where to branch from, where to branch to.
Handling pull requests and how to manage longer lived branches.
And handling branches with dependencies.
Part 2 would be more into Continuous Integration and Feature Toggles.
Also, this is going to be very opinionated and say do things
this one way. But with git you can obviously do the same thing in a variety of ways.
